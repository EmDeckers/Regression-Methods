# Regression-Methods
Comparing The Effectiveness of Two Regression Methods
Stochastic Gradient Descent vs. Multi Layer Perception Neural Networks

In this project, I challenged myself to learn about machine learning algorithms and their implementation. 

The following code uses regression models and the California Housing Dataset from Scikit Learn 
to compare the effectiveness of the stochastic gradient descent method and the neural networks method. 
The time to train each method is provided as well as their individual residual score. 
A graphic was created to visualize the difference in the methods.
